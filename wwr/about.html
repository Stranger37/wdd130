            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In the beginning, the challenges were many: gaining the trust of customers, investing in safety equipment, finding the best rivers for practicing the sport.
                But the passion for what they did was the driving force. With each expedition, the team learned and improved their techniques, making the adventures increasingly safer and more exciting.
                An important milestone was that we were able to practice the sport in Jalapão in the state of Tocantins in Brazil.
                A destination with paradisiacal landscapes and the possibility of spotting wild animals.
